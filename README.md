This demo illustrates how to use the WGL_NV_DX_Interop extension to efficiently share a resource between DirectX and OpenGL rendering APIs. The intent is to provide common variations of the implementation, as well as a way to enable a performance comparison between CPU and GPU resource copies. 

## Note

Since the time the original article was written, it seems like the Nvidia driver no longer supports this extension, resulting in failures ranging from black screens to kernel mode driver crashes.
